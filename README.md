## Ahmad Hassan

I'm a passionate Computer Science student with a strong interest in Data Analytics & ML . Currently studying at Foundation University Islamabad, I enjoy building practical solutions through programming and hands-on projects.

From developing an AI-based Tic-Tac-Toe game with difficulty modes in Java to creating a multilingual translator app in Python, I thrive on turning ideas into working software. I'm also comfortable working with databases like PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server, and have experience in visualizing data using Power BI.

Beyond coding, I've spent several years tutoring high school students in Physics, Chemistry, Math, and Computer Science. This experience has sharpened my communication and problem-solving skillsâ€”traits I bring into every team or project Iâ€™m a part of.
 Iâ€™m constantly learning and looking for opportunities to grow through real-world tech challenges.
